## Abstract
This is a standard for operating cash flow in community. The set of smart contract interfaces defines how the operating cash are running in the a community where NFT tokens are taken as ID Passes.
Interfaces mainly include NFT refund, royaltiy distribution, devidend distribution.
  
This standard defines, for a community, a royalty account for colleting and distributing NFT royalties, and a treasury account for managing all other cash flows except NFT royalty.

As community ID Pass, NFT is EIP-721 compatibable, which can be either complete Non-fungile or semi-fungible.
  
## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this EIP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this standard? What benefit does it provide to the Ethereum ecosystem? What use cases does this EIP address?

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every [EIP-726](./eip-726.md) compliant contract must implement the EIP-726, EIP-721 and [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) interfaces**

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is backward compatible with EIP-721.

## Security Considerations
The state-mutable functions of this EIP are only allowed to be called by the ERC-726 contract owner, authrized operator, or pre-registered address, except the etherInflow() and assetInflow(). Implementations of this EIP must obey this principle.

More attention should be paid to ensure that the asset (both ether and non-ether assets) inflow/outflow functions not be hackered with either amount or address. 

Since this EIP is EIP-721 compatible, any wallets and smart contracts that can hold and manipulate standard EIP-721 tokens will have no risks of asset loss for EIP-726 tokens.
